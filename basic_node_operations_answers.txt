> Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Sort - goes through the file, pulls every line, puts it into an array, sorts it, outputs the lines in a string format
WC - uses a number of functions to get the size of the file in bytes, number of lines, and word count.
Uniq - same as sort, except we dedupe the array at the end.

> Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

Using the pipe, I grabbed the first file in a directory. Using that as an ouput, I sorted the contents of that file name using the sort command.

> Practice:

let reverseString = (inputString) => {

  let stringArray = inputString.split(" ");
  let newArray = [];

  stringArray.forEach((item) => {

    let temp = item.split("");

    let reversedString = "";
    for(let i = temp.length; i>0; i--) reversedString+=temp[i-1];

    newArray.push(reversedString);
  });
  return newArray.join(" ");
}
